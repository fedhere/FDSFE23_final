FDSFE 2023 Final Exam


**RULES: work alone.**

That's it. That's the only rule. You can ask as many questions as you want -- and I strongly encourage to ask if you are stuck, don't stay stuck --- **on the slack channel #final**. Not in a DM, so that all instructors can see the questions and help you and other students can benefit.

Turn in by sharing the notebook with fbianco@udel.edu and rodiat@udel.edu - NOT by posting on GitHub. Make sure you give me and Ridiat _full_ access as "Editors"

Keep in mind this means we see the history of the notebook. Which means if you get code from someone and copy and paste it on the notebook it will show that you made changes in too short a time, so another way for us to check that you are not cheating. **The notebook you share must be the one you worked on from the beginning of the exam**.
