FDSFE 2023 Final Exam


**RULES: work alone.**

That's it. That's the only rule. You can ask as many questions as you want -- and I strongly encourage to ask if you are stuck, don't stay stuck --- **on the slack channel #final**. Not in a DM, so that all instructors can see the questions and help you and other students can benefit.
